  <p>The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry,
    and to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences
    to communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed
    moving images along with other sensory stimulations.
